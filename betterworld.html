	<h1>A BETTER WORLD</h1>
	<img src="images/bjerg earth.svg" alt="world" class="world">
	<h3>Leave your body behind. Be whoever, wherever, whenever, whatever you want to be.
		Reshape your life without the material and homeostatic needs of your old body.</h3>
	<h3>Over 4 million people have uploaded themselves and ascended to a new form
		of existence, and that number is growing fast. Don’t be left behind in this
		new phase of humanity.</h3>
	<h3>The current human form of existence is outdated and unsustainable on our
		planet as it exists. Why continue the failed experiment of this way of living?
		Make the choice today to evolve. Become something more, something new in a new
		frontier.</h3>
	<h2>Through Bjerg you can have it all.</h2>
	<h3>Free yourself from human bodily needs and the compulsions of baser wants
		that were the result of millions of years of random trial and error. Embrace
		the freedom to pursue your passions without the biological limitations of a
		body that is susceptible to disease and breakdown.</p>
	<h3>We’ve found that as our members age beyond their natural lifespans, in a
		world without material concern, that empathy, compassion, tolerance, curiosity
		and wisdom increase. With endless life comes endless opportunities to learn.</h3>
	<h3>The abandonment of your organic body may feel like an immense change, and it
		is. But a new phase of human existence has begun, one that is better for us as
		a species and the Earth we call home, so please, join us in this next step for
		our species.</h3>
