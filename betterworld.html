	<h1>A BETTER WORLD</h1>
	<p>Leave your body behind.  Be whoever, wherever, whenever, whatever you want to be.  Without the material and homeostatic needs of your old body, reshape your life at the lowest premium ever.</p>
	<p>Over 4 billion people have chosen to upload themselves, and that number is growing fast.  Don’t be left behind in this new phase of humanity.</p>
	<p>Modern Human quality of life is unsustainable on the planet as it exists now.  Why make the choice between your quality of life and the systems that support it, and the health of the planet?</p>
		<h2>Through Bjerg you can have it all.</h2>
		<p>Free from bodily needs and the power of baser wants, you will find more time and energy than ever to pursue your passions. </p>
				<p>We’ve found that as our members age beyond their natural lifespans, in a world without material concern, that empathy, compassion and tolerance increase.  With endless life comes endless opportunities to learn.</p>
		<p>The abandonment of your birth body may feel like an immense decision, because it is.  But we are in a new phase of human existence, one that is better for both us as a species and the Earth we call home, so please, join us in this next step for our species.</p>
