	<h1>THE BUBBLE</h1>
				<!-- <img src="images/bjerg vial.svg" alt="science" class="graphics"> -->
				<h3>Bjerg began as a coalition of like-minded people who rejected the old accepted societal and geo-political structures and sought to create a new form of living in which all beings were equal in a post scarcity utopia. The members of Bjerg spent most of their lives working towards the goal of perfecting the technology to upload a human mind into a digital simulation. Many of the members even uploaded themselves as part of the development of the technology, as they had no other way to test their technology. After 30 years of developing this technology in isolation, Bjerg finally announced their breakthrough to the world, and changed the nature of human existence forever.</h3>
				<h3>In order to ensure the purity of this new society, Bjerg decided to only allow certain types of people into this new world. Only those that agreed to reject all former notions of human society, such as all political ideologies, all concepts of ownership and competition, any ideas of inequality or inherent worthiness would be allowed to ascend to this new form of existence.</h3>
